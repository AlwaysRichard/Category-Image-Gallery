**Category Image Gallery** is a lightweight, flexible WordPress plugin for displaying image galleries automatically generated from post categories.

### Key Shortcode Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `category_slug` | Slug of the category to pull images from. |
| `layout` | `tiled`, `collage`, `grid`, or `masonry`. |
| `row_height` | Base height (px) for tiled rows. |
| `tolerance` | Flex factor (0‚Äì0.6). Larger = smoother row balancing. |
| `panorama_thresh` | Aspect ratio (e.g. 2.6) at which an image fills a full row. |
| `min_per_row`, `max_per_row` | Soft bounds on images per row. |
| `last_row` | `left` (not stretched) or `justify`. |

| `link_thumbnail_to` | `image` (opens lightbox) or `post` (links to post). Default: `post`. |
| `display_meta` | EXIF metadata template (e.g., `"{Camera} ‚Ä¢ f/{FNumber} ‚Ä¢ ISO {ISO}"`) shown as image captions in lightbox. |
| `cycle` | `hourly`, `daily`, or blank ‚Äî randomize refresh frequency. |

## üîç Lightbox & Metadata Features

### Built-in Lightbox
All thumbnail interactions open images in a beautiful, full-screen lightbox that:
- **Never redirects** users away from your page
- Supports **keyboard navigation** (arrow keys, escape)
- Shows **EXIF metadata** as captions when configured
- Includes **previous/next navigation** for gallery browsing
- Works seamlessly with the **click menu** system

### EXIF Metadata Display
Use the `display_meta` attribute to show camera information and other metadata:

```text
display_meta="{Camera} ‚Ä¢ {Lens} ‚Ä¢ f/{FNumber} ‚Ä¢ {ShutterSpeed}s ‚Ä¢ ISO {ISO}"
```

**Available metadata tokens:**
- `{Camera}` ‚Äî Camera make and model
- `{Lens}` ‚Äî Lens information  
- `{FNumber}` ‚Äî Aperture (f-stop)
- `{ShutterSpeed}` ‚Äî Shutter speed
- `{ISO}` ‚Äî ISO sensitivity
- `{FocalLength}` ‚Äî Focal length
- `{Copyright}` ‚Äî Copyright information
- `{FileName}` ‚Äî Original filename

### Category Hierarchy
The plugin now automatically includes images from **all descendant categories** (children, grandchildren, etc.) when you specify a parent category, giving you comprehensive category-based galleries.

## üß± Layout Examples

```text
[category_image_gallery category_slug="us-national-parks" layout="tiled" row_height="230" tolerance="0.30" panorama_thresh="2.6" min_per_row="1" max_per_row="3" last_row="left" gutter="4" v_gutter="4" include_draft="true" click_menu="true" display_meta="{FocalLength} | {FNumber} | {ShutterSpeedValue} | {ISOSpeedRatings} -- {Copyright,Richard Cox}"]
```
**Tiled (Jetpack-style justified layout)**  
Balances rows automatically based on image aspect ratios.

**Collage (Metro layout)**  
Images span variable columns and rows; excellent for IR or travel galleries.

## üîê Draft and Login Logic

| Post Status | Logged-In User | Behavior |
|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Published | Any | Thumbnail opens lightbox; click menu shows "Image" (lightbox) and "Post" (link) options |
| Draft / Private | ‚úÖ | Same as published |
| Draft / Private | üö´ | Thumbnail opens lightbox; click menu shows "Image" (lightbox) only |

**Security Note:** Direct image URLs are never exposed in the browser address bar or accessible via right-click. All image viewing happens through the secure lightbox system.

---

## üß∞ Installation

1. Copy the plugin folder into `/wp-content/plugins/category-image-gallery/`.  
2. Activate **Category Image Gallery** from your WordPress admin ‚Üí *Plugins*.  
3. Use the shortcode in any post, page, or block.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Notes

- Images are fetched via `WP_Query` based on the category and all its descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.).  
- When `include_draft="true"`, attachments from unpublished posts are included in the gallery.  
- Visibility and linking behavior are determined at render time based on `get_post_status()` and `is_user_logged_in()`.  
- The JavaScript portion performs live layout adjustments for justified (tiled) and collage modes, plus handles the lightbox functionality.
- Built-in lightbox system prevents direct image URL exposure and keeps users engaged on your site.
- EXIF metadata extraction supports various camera data points with customizable display templates.
- CSS variables (`--ap-gap`, `--ap-vgap`, `--ap-cols`, etc.) make the layout theme-friendly and easily overridable.
